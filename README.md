Sample Sharpen external configuration
=====================

This repository contains a maven project with extensive default customization controls for converting Java to C# using the  [Sharpen project](https://github.com/mono/sharpen). For a version the latest version that compiles and runs under Java 8 see my version until pull requests are initiated and integrated: https://github.com/HankG/sharpen

Just build this as a java library and place into the [Sharpen project](https://github.com/mono/sharpen) directory.
